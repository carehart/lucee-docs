The time interval (in milliseconds) between stack trace captures. Lower values provide
more detailed analysis but generate larger log files and may impact performance.

Recommended ranges:

- 1-10ms: Very detailed analysis, higher overhead
- 10-100ms: Balanced detail and performance
- 100ms+: Lower detail, minimal performance impact
